# Welcome to my Udacity Landing Page Project
*I orginally started this project to use for my profolio on my own personal website that I have been developing in my spare time. You will see to images I have used that I am currently using live on my site and figured it would be a nice touch. I pulled it from 123rf! I have struggled with making a deadline with this project due to irl situation with family and between work!
